# dahliaOS Flake

## Outputs

This is a TODO list for me mainly. Not every repo/project by dahliaOS will be here.
This will primarily be dev shells and packages usable from the dahliaOS organization.
Docs coming soon.

- [ ] Review each element for fit in package, dev shell, or exclusion.
- [ ] For each application, ensure dev shell is present.
